                    <p>One day during COVID-19, five Harvard students decided to build a children’s anthology of
                        stories
                        from around the world. Submissions came from children as young as two years old to college
                        students and professional published authors from various locations ranging from England,
                        Tanzania, Taiwan, the United States, and Australia. As a result, the anthology illustrates
                        the
                        power of diverse voices coming together in the face of an unprecedented global pandemic.</p>

                    <p>This is a colorful and positive anthology, expansive in scope and unrivaled in quality. At
                        its
                        core, this incredible anthology is about the power of community, and its stories are
                        designed
                        for sharing and reading aloud. Readers of this book are sure to discover new family
                        favorites
                        and future classics like My Masked Friends, Pine Cone Stew, and The Mouse and the Squirrel,
                        among many other vibrant stories and poems. Other tales include stories of talking giraffes,
                        heroic battles in the Kingdom of Corona and intergalactic rescue missions.</p>

                    <p>This marvelous edition includes lovingly-drawn illustrations, a warm introduction from the
                        editors, fun coloring pages, and a fantastic bucket list. As a comforting collection during
                        a
                        troubling time, a keepsake in a historical year, and a strong support for a child’s love of
                        reading, this collection belongs in every child’s hands. Lastly, all proceeds from this
                        anthology will go towards the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicefusa.org/">UNICEF</a>
                        fund for
                        humanitarian relief.</p>

                        Singapore, and the United States.

                    <p>As a non-profit public service club, we knew we wanted to donate all proceeds to an
                        organization that supports children! However, we're also dedicated to making the book affordable for readers who wanted a vibrant paperback to read under the covers with a flashlight. This ~150 page anthology costs about ~$10 to print
                        on KDP, but after
                        Amazon takes a portion for hosting the book on its platform, we receive less than $3 per
                        each print anthology to gift to UNICEF. We also offer the book on Blurb so that we can use its service to display
                        the
                        book in a readable format (scroll to the top to see!). Blurb offers a higher printing fee and we
                        receive less than a dollar
                        for our UNICEF fund per each $30 print copy. By displaying the book for free on our website, we
                        hope that those interested in supporting us consider donating directly to the gofundme to help
                        get the book to kids who would not otherwise be able to afford one, nor access the online
                        version. Thank you so much for your generosity and supporting our mission to promote literacy for all children! </p>
